# Ostrowski Theorem in Lean

(Very rough outline & task distribution)

* Absolute value on Q is determined by its values on the positive integers TODO

* Statement: We will prove
(a) |n| = n^t for all n in Nat (definition: Fabrizio & Sylvain)
(b) n = |n|^t_p for some prime p and all n in Nat (definition: Francesco & Nirvana).

* By cases, according to |n| > 1 or |n| <= 1

Case 1. When |n| > 1, we show (a) (Amos & Laura)

Case 2. When |n| <= 1, we show (b) (Sam)
